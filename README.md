## Installation

1. Upload the `custom-cursor-plugin.php` file to your WordPress plugins directory:
   - `/wp-content/plugins/custom-cursor/`

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Navigate to 'Custom Cursor' in the WordPress admin menu

## Usage

### Step 1: Basic Setup

1. Go to **Custom Cursor** in the WordPress admin menu
2. Check "Enable custom cursor functionality" to activate the plugin
3. Upload an image file (any size - it will be automatically optimized)
   - Click "üì§ Upload Image" right next to the file selector
4. Select your preferred **cursor size** (16px to 64px, default is 32px ‚≠ê)

### Step 2: Configure Animations (Optional)

1. Choose an **animation type** from the dropdown (Pulse, Spin, Bounce, Shake, Glow, or None)
2. Click "Advanced Animation Options" to expand additional settings:
   - Select animation speed (‚ö° Fast to ü¶• Very Slow)
   - Toggle "Loop animation continuously" for infinite animation
   - Enable "Pulse on click" for click interaction feedback

### Step 3: Add Visual Effects (Optional)

1. Click "Advanced Visual Effects" to expand styling options:
   - Choose a **blend mode** for creative color mixing effects
   - Enable **drop shadow** and pick a custom color for depth

### Step 4: Save and Get Shortcode

1. Click the large "üíæ Save All Settings" button at the bottom of the page
2. You'll see a success message confirming all settings were saved
3. The shortcode will appear in a dedicated card:
   ```
   [custom_cursor]
   ```
4. Click "üìã Copy Shortcode" for one-click copying
5. Paste the shortcode into any WordPress page or post where you want the custom cursor

## How It Works

- The shortcode applies the custom cursor to the entire page when activated
- **For static cursors:** Uses CSS `cursor` property with your image URL
- **For animated cursors:** Creates a floating div element that tracks mouse movement
- All animations use CSS3 keyframes for smooth performance
- Visual effects (blend modes, shadows) are applied via CSS filters
- Click animations respond to mousedown/mouseup events
- Falls back to default cursor if the custom image fails to load

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- GD or ImageMagick library (usually included with WordPress)

## Browser Compatibility

The custom cursor feature is supported in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

## Troubleshooting

**Cursor not changing:**
- Make sure the plugin is enabled in settings
- Verify the shortcode `[custom_cursor]` is on the page
- Check that the image uploaded successfully
- Try a different image format (PNG works best for cursors)

**Image too large:**
- The plugin automatically resizes images, but smaller source images work better
- Recommended: Upload images close to your selected size for best quality

**Animation not working:**
- Verify an animation type other than "None" is selected
- Check that the page has fully loaded
- Try a different animation type to isolate the issue
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser

**Cursor appears too large/small:**
- Adjust the cursor size setting (16px-64px options available)
- Re-upload the image after changing the size setting
