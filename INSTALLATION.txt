CUSTOM CURSOR PLUGIN - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================

QUICK START:

1. Create a folder called 'custom-cursor' in your WordPress plugins directory:
   /wp-content/plugins/custom-cursor/

2. Upload these files to that folder:
   - custom-cursor-plugin.php
   - admin.js

3. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins → Activate "Custom Cursor Plugin"

4. Go to WordPress Admin → Custom Cursor (in the sidebar menu)

5. Upload your cursor image and enable the feature

6. Copy the shortcode: [custom_cursor]

7. Paste the shortcode on any page or post where you want the custom cursor

THAT'S IT!

NOTES:
- Images larger than 32x32 pixels will be automatically resized
- The cursor will apply to the entire page where the shortcode is placed
- You can use PNG, JPG, GIF, or WEBP images
- For best results, use a PNG image with transparency
